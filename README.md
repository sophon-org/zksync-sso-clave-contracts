## Running development

1. Install workspace dependencies with PNPM.

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. Start up the Verdaccio proxy registry.

   ```bash
   npx nx local-registry
   ```

3. Publish the SDK package to your proxy registry.

   ```bash
   npx nx publish:local sdk
   ```

## Running commands

Use the NX CLI to run project commands, however PNPM is still usable as an
alternative. Project names are based on the name defined in each project's
`project.json`.

```bash
npx nx <target> <project>
# Example
npx nx build sdk
```

To run a command in multiple projects, use the `run-many` command.

```bash
npx nx run-many -t <target> --all           # for all projects
npx nx run-many -t <target> -p proj1 proj2  # by project
npx nx run-many --targets=lint,test,build   # run multiple commands
```

Some commands are inferred and built-in with NX. To review all the available
commands in a project:

```bash
nx show project <project> --web
```
